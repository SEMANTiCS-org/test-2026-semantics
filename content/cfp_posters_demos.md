The SEMANTiCS 2026 Posters and Demos Track offers a platform for late-breaking research results, ongoing or early-stage projects, innovative ideas grounded on on-going research, prototypes, systems, applications, datasets, and other cutting-edge contributions relevant to semantic technologies. We welcome submissions that showcase emerging research directions as well as practical solutions demonstrating the impact of semantic technologies across academic and industrial settings. We warmly encourage contributions from individuals of all genders, backgrounds, and career stages — including students, early-career researchers from academia and industry, and those from groups traditionally underrepresented in our community.

This track is designed to foster interactive discussion and constructive feedback. The informal and engaging format encourages dialogue between presenters and attendees, offering an ideal opportunity to refine ideas, receive input, and explore collaborations in a supportive environment. We also very much encourage submissions from industry, but they should be focused on presenting a novel solution to a specific problem and not be in the nature of an advertisement or commercial product description.

## Topics of Interest

We invite contributions related to **Semantic Web**, **Knowledge Graphs**, Linked Data, and semantic-based systems and technologies which address – but are not limited to – the topics of the conference’s Research and Innovation, and Industry and Use Cases tracks. We also strongly encourage:

- On-going/Completed work
  - Novel prototypes or systems
  - New publicly available datasets
  - Novel algorithms or tools
  - Negative results
- Future work
  - Position papers (e.g., work partially done, or discussing ideas grounded on current evidence or results)
  - Project proposals that were recently accepted

## Distinction between Posters and Demos

Both Poster and Demos fall in the same topics of interest, page length, format, and review process. The distinction stands on the presentation format and awards, as there will be a separate award for best poster and separate for best demo. Demos are expected to provide a video link with their submission that presents the work submitted. Working systems, tools and prototypes at the time of the submission are encouraged to submit their papers as demos.

## Review Criteria

Submissions must clearly demonstrate their relevance to the aforementioned topics of SEMANTiCS 2026. Reviews will evaluate:

- **Relevance** to the topics of interest
- **Originality** and novelty of the contribution
- **Significance** and potential impact
- **Topicality**, i.e., the timeliness and current relevance of the work
- **Clarity** and quality of presentation

The Posters & Demos Track aims to enable the presentation of **preliminary, ongoing, and innovative work**, provided that the submission offers a meaningful and original contribution to the community. Each submission will be reviewed by **three** qualified members of the Program Committee.

## Author Guidelines and Submission Requirements

Poster and demo submissions should consist of a paper that describes the work, its contribution to the field or innovative aspects.

- **Length**: Up to 5 pages long, including references.
- **Submission Policy**: Single-anonymous (authors named; reviewers anonymous).
- **Format**: Submissions must be formatted in PDF or HTML in the style of [CEUR-ART](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html). An [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw) for LaTeX users is available. For all details, please refer to the CEUR submission instructions.
- **Originality**: Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere.
- **If the submitted work complements an accepted full paper**, authors should cite the full paper and clearly explain the added value (e.g., extended results, prototype demonstration)
- **Links**: Authors should ensure that the demoed version is available online for inspection. If this is not possible, authors are encouraged to submit a link to a video of their system (max 2 minutes duration). This will positively support the overall assessment of the contribution.
- **Ethics** and Environmental footprint: How does the work described in your submission relate to ethical issues and how does it affect the environment?
- **Declaration on Generative AI**: Submissions must adhere to the fair use of Large Language Models. Please refer to the SEMANTiCS full policy for more details: [llm-policy](https://2026-eu.semantics.cc/page/llm-policy), and **must provide a declaration** as stated in [CEUR’s GenAI Policy](https://ceur-ws.org/GenAI/Policy.html).

## Submission

All submissions must be made electronically via EasyChair following this link: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=semantics2026](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=semantics2026).

## Conference Attendance, Proceedings, and Presentation Format

- At least one author of each accepted submission must register for the conference and present the work in person.
- Accepted Posters and Demos will be published open access via CEUR-WS.org.
- The presentation format for accepted posters will be a physical poster. For demos, authors will be expected to present an on-site demonstration.
- We also recommend that presenting authors print their scientific posters using recycled paper or on fabric.

## Accessibility Statement

- We are aiming to have an accessible and barrier free Posters and Demos room with an accessible restroom in proximity.
- We are aiming to provide a fully detailed floor plan with the exact locations of each Poster and Demo, similar to last year (see [https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/page/posters](https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/page/posters)). Further, we are in discussions with the venue to ensure that each presenter gets the maximum available space — without colliding with other posters or demos — so that they can receive the dedicated audience for their work as they deserve. Finally, we are clarifying whether food and drinks can be served to the presenters at their stands during their presentations, so they are guaranteed to experience the same quality as everyone else.
- Aligned with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI):
  - **Posters** are expected to submit an image of their poster accompanied by rich metadata on the alternative description for assistive technologies (alt text). You can find more information on how to formulate alt text at [https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) .
  - **Demos** are expected to submit a video of their work accompanied by rich metadata on video description, captions, and transcripts. For recording your video, kindly consider the guidelines provided by WAI at [https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/av-content/#video ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/). You can find information about how to formulate video captions at [https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/captions/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/captions/), video transcripts at [https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/), and video descriptions at [https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/description/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/description/).

There will be a designated Quiet room available in proximity to the Posters and Demos room. You will be able to find it in the floor plan and via signs in the venue.
