# Guidelines for reviewing and reproducibility

Please read the following carefully and comprehensively. Papers submitted to the Research and Innovation track will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

- Appropriateness
- Originality, novelty, and innovativeness
- Impact of results
- Soundness of the evaluation
- Proper comparison to related work
- Clarity and quality of writing
- Reproducibility of results and resources

## Open Review Process and Publication

While we will adopt a double-anonymous peer review process, reviewers **can decide to disclose their identity** by signing their reviews. In this case, we suggest accompanying the reviewer’s name with one of its persistent identifiers (e.g. ORCID).

The text of all the reviews (excluding final recommendations) of all the accepted papers will be posted on the conference website with the basic bibliographic metadata of the reviewed submission (i.e. title and authors), and it will be archived on Zenodo as publicly available material. All the reviews of accepted papers that reviewers have signed will be licensed using a [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license (CC-BY, the copyright holder will be the reviewer). A [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) waiver will accompany the text of the other anonymous reviews of accepted papers.

To enable the publication of the review text and following some shared guidelines such as those introduced in the Publish Your Review initiative (https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews), we ask the reviewers to make sure that **the text of the review does not reveal any confidential information**, such as mentions of the conference (i.e. SEMANTiCS 2026) at which the submission was under review and the final recommendation and score for acceptance/rejection (that should be specified in specific fields of the review form, not in the review text).

## Reviewing Principles (FAST)

Each review must be prepared according to the **FAST principles for reviewing** (described at https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback):

- **Focussed** – focus on the content of the paper, focus on the science and not the conference venue, and focus on the science and not the personal;
- **Appropriate** – polish the tone, reflect on the possible bias, engage in scientific discourse, and behave responsibly and with integrity;
- **Specific** – make it useful, indicate if critical or optional, assess whether claims are supported by the data, and be candid;
- **Transparent** – sign (or not) your review, acknowledge oversights, and credit contributors.

A description of such principles with (positive and negative) examples is available at https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback.

## Reproducibility Requirements

A particular focus must be given to the **availability of all relevant materials that are necessary to reproduce the outcomes** described in the submission. Such materials should be made available as proper entities archived in appropriate repositories to guarantee their availability in the long term, a necessary condition to guarantee reproducibility. In addition, such materials should be **properly cited within the bibliographic reference lists** of the submission using an appropriate persistent identifier (e.g. a DOI).

Among the possible kinds of material to include there are:

- software developed and/or reused as part of an analysis;
- a precise description of the protocol (sequence of steps, system configurations, software versions used, etc.) adopted to gather data and/or run an analysis;
- the raw datasets used in an experiment;
- the output datasets produced as the outcome of an analysis/experiment;
- models (e.g. ontologies and ML models) used in the experiment;

New material produced within the work described in the submission can be archived in either general purposes repositories (e.g. Zenodo, https://zenodo.org/) or repositories devoted to specific kinds of material, such as Software Heritage for software (https://www.softwareheritage.org/), Protocols.io for protocols and workflows (https://www.protocols.io/), and FAIR Sharing for metadata standards and databases (https://fairsharing.org/). Usually, **these repositories should return persistent identifiers** that can be used to cite the material properly in the submission.

The authors **must explicitly justify** in their submission whether scenarios **prevent their work's full reproducibility**. Examples of these scenarios may include situations where the material used cannot be archived openly due to intellectual property rights issues or other legal concerns, such as personal data.

## Guidelines on Generative AI

The authors must, at the end of the paper, explicitly and visibly include a **Declaration on Generative AI**. For example, the authors may state if they used it for translation, spellchecking, etc. Please see a sample declaration [here](https://ceur-ws.org/GenAI/Policy.html#footnote). Reviewers are responsible for verifying the presence of this declaration.

Reviewers **must not use GenAI** to generate or write any part of their review. Reviews must reflect their own understanding, expertise, and critical thinking.

Moreover, reviewers should be careful to not insinuate proficiency with a language against quality of writing, providing statements related to clarity, narrative flow, paper structure, and presence of typos. Similarly, it should not be insinuated that the writing is performed (solely) by GenAI, but should point to specific errors or inclusions, unless there is clear evidence as such (e.g., inclusion of a prompt, well-known statements attributed to GenAI responses (e.g., “Great question, …”), etc.). Conversely, the use of em/en dashes does not in itself imply GenAI usage.

## Ethical Standards and Conduct

**Confidentiality:** All submissions must be maintained as strictly confidential. Sharing or discussing manuscript contents outside of the official review process is prohibited.

**Conflict of Interest:** Reviewers identifying a potential conflict of interest regarding a submission, must report it immediately and step down from the assignment immediately.

**Tone and Civility:** Reviews must remain professional, constructive, and balanced. Please ensure feedback addresses both merits and limitations respectfully, avoiding any dismissive or derogatory language.
