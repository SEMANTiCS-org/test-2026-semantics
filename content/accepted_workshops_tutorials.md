<p>The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has revolutionized various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and creative industries. Models such as GPT, DALL·E, and others have demonstrated the immense potential of generative AI in creating realistic, coherent, and often groundbreaking outputs across a wide range of domains. However, the application of these generative models to scientific discovery and problem-solving remains an emerging area, filled with opportunities and challenges. Science is inherently generative: it involves creating hypotheses, designing experiments, interpreting data, and communicating results. Generative AI has the potential to augment these processes by automating routine tasks, enabling hypothesis generation, synthesizing complex information, and uncovering insights from vast datasets. Scientific data is often sparse, noisy, and domain-specific, requiring models to understand and adhere to rigorous scientific principles and constraints. Issues such as model interpretability, reproducibility, and ethical use are particularly critical in scientific applications, where errors or biases can have far-reaching consequences. The SymGenAI4Sci 2026 workshop aims to address these challenges and explore the transformative potential of symbolic and generative AI in scientific research</p>

<p>It's 2026 and we still can't visit any website without clicking ""Yes"" on a cookie banner, exchanging access to our most private data for the right to browse around. Managing and enforcing our privacy preferences in a personalised manner is also quite challenging. Additionally, data protection laws are emerging exponentially following in the footsteps of the GDPR. </p>
<p>In this context, the NeXt-generation Data Governance 2026 workshop aims to bring together technical, legal and societal researchers, and industry experts to discuss data governance, emergence of data spaces and the impact of the European strategy for data in such systems. The workshop aims to support the development of solutions to manage data, policies and provenance in a trustful and interoperable manner and to aid in the management and reporting of legal documentation falling from the EU’s GDPR for data protection and the DGA, Data Act, AI Act and EHDS to create legally-aligned, AI-powered data ecosystems, using semantic-based specifications such as ODRL, DPV or Solid. As such, this workshop will have presentations and discussions of interest to both data providers and consumers, researchers, standardisation bodies, businesses, and citizens who want to interoperate in the Data Spaces era.</p>

<p>As industrial systems evolve from hardware-centric systems with guaranteed deterministic performance into distributed software-oriented ecosystems, their complexity increases significantly. Catalyzed by the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) alongside the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), it becomes increasingly challenging to understand the internal workings of these systems. Semantic modeling and reasoning can play a key role in enhancing transparency and explainability by providing formal representations and a common language to capture the relationships, dependencies, and decision-making processes within these complex industrial systems. The SENTIS workshop aims to connect practitioners in the domain of industrial systems with researchers by providing a platform for presentation of projects as well as individual research contributions.</p>

<p>While the technical aspects of KG construction and reasoning have seen significant advancements, the human element often remains under-explored. Many KGs, despite their rich semantic structure, are not readily accessible or understandable to their intended users. This disconnect can hinder the adoption and effective use of KGs in various domains. This workshop is motivated by the growing recognition of the crucial role of user interaction in the success of KG-based systems. There is a need to understand: How users perceive and interact with KGs. What challenges do users encounter when querying, exploring, or contributing to KGs? How can KG-based applications be designed to be more intuitive and user-friendly? What evaluation metrics and methodologies are appropriate for assessing user interaction with KGs? By bringing together researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, this workshop aims to identify key research directions and foster collaborative efforts to address these challenges. A deeper understanding of user interaction with KGs is essential for unlocking the full potential of this technology and enabling its widespread adoption.</p>

    <b>Making Knowledge Graphs AI-Ready - A Practical Guide for Quality Assessment and Improvement in GraphRAG Systems</b>
  </p>
  <p>Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by grounding their responses in structured knowledge graphs, offering more accurate, domain-specific, and explainable outputs. However, many graphs used in these pipelines are automatically generated or loosely assembled, often lacking the semantic clarity, structure, and consistency required for reliable grounding. The result is misleading retrieval, vague or incomplete answers, and hallucinations that are difficult to trace or fix.</p>

  <p>This hands-on tutorial introduces a practical framework for assessing and improving the quality of knowledge graphs in GraphRAG applications. Participants will explore common failure patterns, analyze real-world examples, and use a reusable checklist of criteria for determining whether a graph is truly “AI-ready.” The session will provide concrete techniques for spotting modeling issues, gaps, and inconsistencies that undermine GraphRAG performance, and share strategies to improve semantic reliability and retrieval effectiveness. Designed for practitioners and researchers who build or manage knowledge graphs in LLM contexts, the tutorial bridges semantic modeling practices with the new demands of generative AI.</p>

    <b>Building Streaming and Cross-Environment Data Processing Pipelines with RDF-Connect</b>
  </p>
  <p>RDF-Connect is a novel, language-agnostic framework for building provenance-aware, streaming data pipelines integrating heterogeneous processors across languages. It aims to facilitate the construction, maintenance, and reusability of modular, interoperable pipelines for complex, semantically rich data workflows. Data processing pipelines are essential for modern data-centric systems, such as knowledge graphs, LLMs, and machine learning systems. Developers and researchers need flexible, interoperable tools for creating multilingual data processing pipelines. To meet this need, we present a comprehensive tutorial that blends conceptual foundations with hands-on experience. Participants will learn how to use RDF-Connect to design and execute reusable, extensible, and transparent streaming pipelines. Participants will construct a streaming data processing pipeline from real-world data: generating a weather forecast knowledge graph for Vienna, Austria. They will: (i) Construct a machinelearning pipeline using processors in multiple programming languages, (ii) Create custom data processors for diverse endpoints, (iii) Explore provenance tracking using RDF and PROV-O ontology. By the end of the tutorial, participants from varied backgrounds, including Python, JavaScript, and Java developers, will gain practical experience building language-agnostic, semantically rich data processing pipelines. This tutorial not only introduces RDF-Connect but also opens new avenues for interdisciplinary data transformation strategies in Semantic Web research and development.</p>
