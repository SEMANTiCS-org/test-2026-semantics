SEMANTiCS 2026 is a major venue for research and industrial innovation and features a workshop and tutorial program addressing the diverse practical interests of its audience. This program is intended to offer a rich diversity of topics to conference attendees and local participants seeking to pick up new skills and stay up-to-date regarding the latest developments in the community. We encourage submissions of proposals on all topics in the general areas of SEMANTiCS 2026 and proposals bridging or introducing new perspectives and/or challenges in these areas. Workshops and tutorials may incorporate a variety of inclusive and engaging formats such as panel discussions, lightning talks, meetings, networking or hands-on sessions, hackathons and other practical formats where applicable. Rooms for business or project meetings are available upon request as well. We warmly encourage submissions from teams and individuals of all genders, backgrounds, and career stages, including those from groups traditionally underrepresented in the community.

## Scope and Goals

Workshops and tutorials at SEMANTiCS 2026 allow your organization or project to advance and share knowledge, as well as build collaborative networks and gain increased visibility. The workshops and tutorials will be announced on the SEMANTiCS website, and disseminated through the conference social media channels for increased visibility. SEMANTiCS 2026 workshops and tutorials can be incubators for industrial and scientific communities that form and share a particular research and development agenda, and they will provide a forum for presenting contributions and findings to a diverse and knowledgeable community. Furthermore, the event can be used as a dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects or as a closed format for research/commercial project consortia meetings.

## Setup and Requirements

SEMANTiCS 2026 workshops and tutorials may be either half or full-day long. Workshops and tutorials take place before the main conference, on 15th of September 2026. Further details will be communicated in due time.

Each workshop and tutorial will receive three complimentary **Single-Day Passes**, intended ONLY for use by organizers or keynote speakers. This pass grants free registration for the specific day of the workshop. Recipients wishing to attend the full conference will receive a 30% discount on total registration fee.

Workshop and tutorial proposals must include the following information:

- outline of the **themes and goals of the event**, including a title and a brief abstract (less than 200 words) intended for the SEMANTiCS 2026 website.
- a statement addressing **why the event is important**, **why the event is timely**, and how it is relevant to SEMANTiCS 2026 and the field of Semantic Web. For the tutorials, why the presenters are qualified for a high-quality introduction to the topic.
- **related workshops and conferences**, i.e., specifying if this is a continuation of a workshop series or a new workshop. Please provide information about past versions (in any) and other related workshops (including URLs and submission/acceptance counts, if available).
- a statement addressing the **quality assurance criteria** that will be used by the event organizers to select the papers for the workshops and the presenters for the tutorials (e.g., peer review or review/evaluation by event organizers). If a peer review process is chosen as a quality assurance criterion for the workshops, the organizers will be responsible for their own reviewing process. Workshop organizers will be responsible also for their own publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for papers) and proceedings production.
- **structure of the event** and plans for generating and stimulating discussion; how will the interaction be organized in case of a hybrid event.
- expected **number of event participants** and (in case of previously held events) number of registered attendees and website for previous editions of the event
- a description of the intended **audience** and the expected learning **outcomes**.
- desired **prerequisite** knowledge of the audience.
- proposed **duration of the event** (i.e., half or full day), different sessions if applicable (final time slot will be assigned in accordance with the SEMANTiCS program).
- any **equipment**, room capacity, or other logistic constraints.
- full **contact information** of all organizers of the event and main contact person; a brief description of each **organizer's background**, including relevant past experience in organizing events.
- submissions must adhere to the fair use of Large Language Models. Please refer to the SEMANTiCS full policy for more details: [llm-policy](https://2026-eu.semantics.cc/page/llm-policy), and **must provide a “Declaration on Generative AI”**.

## Submission

Submissions must be formatted in PDF using the [CEUR-ART](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html) style and maximum 4 pages long. An Overleaf page for LaTeX users is available. For all details, please refer to the CEUR submission instructions.

Proposals for workshops and tutorials must be submitted via [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2026).

## Requirements for Accepted Workshops

If your workshop is accepted, you must adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Website**: You are required to create a dedicated webpage for your workshop that includes the Call for Papers, organizational details, and timelines.
- **Timeline & Deadlines**: You must follow the indicative timeline above. Organizers may grant an additional extension to their authors, provided there is enough time to deliver high quality reviews. The overall deadlines are indicative, yet encouraged to follow to ensure smooth conference coordination.
- **Responsibilities**: While SEMANTiCS chairs will assist with local logistics, organizers are fully responsible for managing the peer review process, workshop publicity, and publishing proceedings (e.g., via CEUR).
- **Registration**: At least one organizer must register for the conference by the **Early Bird** deadline and attend the workshop in person.
- **Cancellation Policy**: The track chairs reserve the right to cancel a workshop if it receives too few submissions or if no organizer registers by the Early Bird deadline.
- **Environmental footprint**: The organizers should make an honest attempt at documenting the environmental footprint of the workshop and comparing this to alternative ways for achieving the workshop’s goals.

## Requirements for Accepted Tutorials

- **Website**: Accepted tutorials must provide a dedicated webpage containing the program schedule and any relevant materials for attendees to download.
- **Technical Recommendations (Software & Services)**: If your tutorial requires specific software or online services, we strongly recommend the following:
  - **Advance Instructions**: Publish prerequisites and installation/registration instructions on your webpage well in advance to help attendees prepare.
  - **Allocated Setup Time**: Dedicate time at the start of the tutorial for installation and troubleshooting, as not all participants will arrive prepared.
  - **Backup Plans**: Prepare for potential WiFi or service disruptions. Have offline backups available (e.g., recorded videos for demos).
- **Registration**: Tutorial presenters must register for the conference by the **Early Bird deadline** and participate in person. Failure to register on time may result in the tutorial being cancelled at the chairs' discretion.
- **Environmental footprint**: The organizers should make an honest attempt at documenting the environmental footprint of the tutorial and comparing this to alternative ways for achieving the tutorial’s goals.

## Proceedings for Tutorials

For **SEMANTiCS 2026**, **only tutorials** may optionally be included in the official conference proceedings through CEUR. The decision to participate rests with the chairs of each tutorial. To be eligible, all tutorial materials must be submitted by **July 31, 2026**. Further details will be communicated later.

Participation in the proceedings is **optional** and **will not affect acceptance decisions**.

## Review and Evaluation Criteria

Workshop and tutorial proposals will be reviewed by the SEMANTiCS 2026 Workshop Chairs, as well as by the SEMANTiCS 2026 organizing committee, according to the following criteria:

- The potential to advance the state of Semantic Web research and practice
- The quality assurance criteria proposed by the organizers to select high-quality papers for workshops and presenters for tutorials
- The organizers' experience and ability to lead a successful event
- Timeliness and expected interest in the event topics
- The balance and synergy between all SEMANTiCS 2026 events

We are looking forward to your contribution!
