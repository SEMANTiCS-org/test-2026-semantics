# W3C Data Façades Community Group (Facade-X) Launches Following SEMANTiCS Origins
##### November 10, 2025 by SEMANTiCS

The [W3C Data Facade Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/facade-x/), known as Facade-X, officially launched its operations with a successful Kick-off Meeting held online on 27 October 2025. This initiative traces its roots directly back to [the research presented at the SEMANTiCS Conference in 2021](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/doi/10.3233/SSW210035), where the data facade concept was first introduced.

The group is chaired by [Enrico Daga](https://www.enridaga.net) (The Open University) and [Luigi Asprino](https://luigi-asprino.github.io) (Università Telematica San Raffaele, Italy), who initially collaborated on the open-source project [SPARQL Anything](https://www.sparql-anything.cc) based on the Facade-X research.

The Facade-X approach originated in 2020 within the [EU SPICE project](https://spice-h2020.eu/), which focused on challenges in integrating cultural heritage data. The primary motivation is to solve integration challenges across highly **heterogeneous data formats**, including not only JSON, CSV, and XML but also HTML, Markdown, Spreadsheets, and others.

Instead of dealing with diverse data sources using independent parsers and complex transformations, the Facade-X approach proposes creating **data facades** —homogeneous RDF views of these sources. This allows data to be expressed in a standard language (RDF) and accessed via **SPARQL querying**.

A key achievement supporting this launch is the development of the **SPARQL Anything** open-source tool. Furthermore, the methodology was formalised in a [2023 ACM Transactions on Internet Technology paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3555312), demonstrating that the approach is general enough to apply to any data source whose format can be described by a formal grammar (like BNF) or any relational database.

The W3C Data Facades Community Group has defined several core objectives aimed at fostering stability and broader adoption of the approach:
- 1. **Specification**: To develop a specification of the data facade approach and its underlying meta-model.
- 2. **Mappings**: To define standardised mappings from various data formats (like the [ones currently supported by SPARQL Anything](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/stable/) ) to the Facade-X model, as well as a process to include new formats.
- 3. **SPARQL Dialect**: To specify a standard SPARQL dialect for facade-based data access.
- 4. **Community Building**: To build a collaborative and interoperable community ecosystem and foster the development of other implementations. This includes opening the collaboration with other W3C Community and Working Groups.

[The inaugural meeting](https://github.com/w3c-facade-x/meetings/tree/main/meetings/2025-10-27), attended by participants including researchers, engineers, and independent consultants, defined the initial road map and technical priorities. The next meeting was rescheduled from November (due to the US Thanksgiving holiday) to **Monday, 1 December 2025**. The primary focus of the next session will be to begin drafting the **meta-model**. Ryan Shaw (University of North Carolina) will present initial use cases to kick off the discussion of practical criticalities and requirements for the specification.

The launch of the [W3C Data Façades Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/facade-x/) provides a dedicated, collaborative forum to develop shared specifications for methods to make heterogeneous data accessible through homogeneous RDF views, leveraging the foundational ideas presented years ago at SEMANTiCS. The process, focusing first on the meta-model specification, is now underway.
