# Improving peer-review with the Open Research Knowledge Graph

The <a href="https://orkg.org/" target="_blank">Open Research Knowledge Graph</a> (ORKG) and the organizing committee of SEMANTiCS 2026 are collaborating to empower the authors and peer reviewers alike. Peer-review is a critical checkpoint for validating the integrity and novelty of scientific contributions. However, the process of peer-review suffers from challenges such as reviewer fatigue and the difficulty in distinguishing true advancements in a field. The ORKG aims to make a transformative impact to refine the peer-review process and enrich the ecosystem of scientific communication, through its structured comparisons. These comparisons organize research contributions in a tabular format, offering a clear overview of the field and can be enhanced with visualizations like bar charts or scatter plots for a more intuitive grasp of the data.

Open Research Knowledge Graph: A lighthouse in the publication flood

The ORKG facilitates a more efficient and insightful peer-review process by offering a platform where researchers can systematically describe and assess their work. For peer reviewers, it provides a concise characterization of submissions by comparing them with related approaches. This not only aids in identifying the unique contributions of a paper but also in understanding its position within the state-of-the-art through ORKG comparisons. These comparisons are not just auxiliary tools; they are recognized as scholarly outputs in their own right, complete with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for easy citation. This feature underscores the ORKG’s potential to enhance the visibility and credibility of research contributions.</p>
