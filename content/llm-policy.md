# Large Language Model Policy

</div>

SEMANTICS 2026 has established a clear policy on Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing from community standards, including the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) and [CEUR-WS.org](https://ceur-ws.org/GenAI/Policy.html).

The underlying policy applies across all conference tracks without distinction between papers designated for the main proceedings or companion proceedings. It imposes the following stringent requirements:

- The submission of text generated entirely by an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot) is prohibited.
- Authors retain the prerogative to utilise LLMs for the purposes of editing, refinement, and linguistic polishing of human-authored content.
- The authors must, at the end of the paper, explicitly and visibly include a **Declaration on Generative AI**. For example, the authors may state if they used it for translation, spellchecking, etc. See <u>Example of Declaration</u> below.
- Reviewers must not use GenAI to generate or write any part of their review. Reviews must reflect their own understanding, expertise, and critical thinking. Moreover, reviewers should not insinuate that the writing is performed (solely) by GenAI, but should point to specific errors or inclusions.

This conservative stance is primarily predicated on safeguarding the integrity of scientific discourse and mitigating potential issues, including plagiarism, inherent in the unchecked use of generative AI.

Finally, this policy is in force for SEMANTiCS 2026 and is subject to evolution in subsequent conferences as the understanding of LLMs and their impact on scientific publishing matures.

## Example of Declaration

This example of declaration is drawn from [CEUR-WS.org](https://ceur-ws.org/GenAI/Policy.html), and applies to all papers regardless of the publisher.

<i>During the preparation of this work, the author(s) used **ChatGPT**, **Grammarly** in order to: **Grammar and spelling check, Paraphrase and reword**. After using this tool/service, the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full responsibility for the publication’s content.</i>

It includes:

- **Tools and services**: A complete listing of all GenAI tools and services employed, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others;
- **Tools’ contributions**: A precise description of the specific contributions made by each GenAI tool or service, categorised in accordance with the established [GenAI Usage Taxonomy](https://ceur-ws.org/GenAI/Taxonomy.html).

The [IOS Press template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gkkspcvjgwxv#563836) for the Research and Innovation Track, and [CEUR template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw) for all other tracks, both on Overleaf, already include this new section.
