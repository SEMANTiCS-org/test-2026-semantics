## Submission Guidelines

**Submissions will be made through Easychair** (see link below) and consist of two mandatory components. First, provide a summary of 200 to 300 words that will be used in the final program. Second, upload a one-page description of the use case you want to present, in particular: initial situation, approach, business value and benefits of the semantic solution, prospects and recommendation. Submissions that do not meet these requirements cannot be taken into account. Please notice that a paper abstract is not necessary, as your submission will only include a presentation at SEMANTiCS and not a paper.

Via Easychair, you will enter your summary in the field “Abstract”, and the full page description via the “upload paper” button. The summary will appear in the program on the webpage, the full page description will only be used in the selection process.

Furthermore, we ask presenters to fill out the online application at Easychair and give us relevant information about your expertise and your professional background.

Finally, submissions must adhere to the fair use of Large Language Models. Please refer to the SEMANTiCS full policy for more details: https://2026-eu.semantics.cc/page/llm-policy

## Submission

All submissions must be made electronically via EasyChair following this link: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=semantics2026](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=semantics2026).

## Review and Evaluation Criteria

Every submission will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.

Submissions to this track will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

- Your presentation is relevant for in-use applications, targeted at a specific business domain or any business domain in general. It illustrates how semantic technologies / solutions contribute to or improve existing businesses and / or generate new ones.
- The presented solution has already been deployed and / or has been tested in a practical environment – at least prototypically.
- Your presentation is well-structured and does bring across its message.
- The topic is well described and covers enough explanations, examples, use cases, graphics, etc.
- Novelty: The topic covered is new to your industry – not necessarily new to business in general

## Guidelines for your talk

All accepted submissions will be granted a presentation slot at the main conference. Please prepare your talk in line with the allotted time. This is the only way we can guarantee a smooth and satisfying programme and allow all conference participants to attend as many slots as possible without missing important information. Please take care to address the following aspects:

- **_Initial Situation_**. What kind of challenge did you face in the beginning of the project? What problems needed to be solved?
- **_Approach and IT-Solution_**. Which approach and methodology has been chosen to tackle the problem(s)? How is your solution composed with respect to technological aspects / human aspects / organisational aspects? How do the semantic components support the process from data to knowledge?
- **_Success Criteria for / Benefit of the Semantic Solution_**. Which factors (conscious and unconscious) have been crucial to the success of your project? Which obstacles did you face? How can you measure the benefit of your solution? How does the organisation benefit from your solution?
- **_Prospects and Recommendations_**. What are the next steps planned in your project? Can you give recommendations with respect to development / deployment of semantic solutions within organisational / corporate settings?
- **_Ethics and Environmental footprint_**. How does your project relate to ethical issues and how does it affect the environment?
- **_Demo_** (if applicable). Prepare a short demonstration of your tool / service.

  All accepted submissions may choose to upload their presentation and additional information to the conference website, to be able to share and refer to during your talk at the conference.
